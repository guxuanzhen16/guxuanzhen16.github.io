Hi, my name is Eric Gu. I am a PhD student in Anthropology at the University of California, Irvine. My work revolves around how people use political and religious practices latent in the fabric of everyday life to envision alternative social possiblities and build community. My previous research includes how people formulate conspiracy theories together on <span title='the website formerly known as'>8chan</span> and how right-wing users with different religious identities debate and attempt to convert one another on <span title='the website formerly known as'>Twitter</span>.

My current dissertation project is on the concept of debate itself: its history within Western liberal thought, its transformations through social media platforms, its affinities with religious modes of engagement (conversion, testimony, charisma, and so on), and its role in both political communication and ethical self-making. Why do people engage in political debate beyond the stated goal of changing the minds of others? How does debate shape who they are and what they want to be, and what unexpected relationships and possibilities might emerge in pursuit of debate? Trained in anthropological theory and ethnographic methods, I aim to take people from all walks of life seriously with the respect and attention they deserve, to understand what people believe and why, and build towards the conditions that would enable us to imagine better futures together.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, foraging, playing TTRPGs, contributing to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia), and [shape-note singing](https://www.fasola-la.org/). Recently I have been getting into using invasive species for food and crafts. I am in the process of moving things I have written about these things into this webpage; more to come!
